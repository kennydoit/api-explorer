For this update to Sophie's list, I've opened up the criteria to highlight what's turned out to be a flourishing genre, anchored by the revival of traditional sitcoms such as Abbott Elementary. The shows I've listed are easy to binge, with most episodes hovering around half an hour or less, and they indulge in humor, whether outright or otherwise. Maybe they'll make you laugh. Maybe they'll inspire you to reflect. Whatever happens, they won't ask too much of your attention span.",

It was really slow, and it took ages, and finally we could see this little bit of purple. It was great.\" Now, assuming the U.S. Department of Agriculture approves their sale in the coming weeks, Martin's tomatoes could be available for the first time-as seeds you can grow or fruit you can buy at the store. But it's also a significant moment to reframe the way we think about genetically modified organisms  ( GMOs )  in produce-not merely as a means to cut costs for Big Agriculture but as an opportunity to take an object that nature gave us and improve upon it, much as we would a smartphone or pair of sneakers. Any tomato breed can be transformed into a purple tomato. And purple tomatoes taste exactly the same as their source varietal because anthocyanines are flavorless. But Martin's research found two other interesting things. Her purple tomatoes-not to be mistaken with dark varietals like black cherry tomatoes-last roughly twice as long on the shelf as a standard tomato. And mice that ate a diet of her purple tomatoes lived 30% longer than those that ate the standard red variety. A human would need to eat the equivalent of two purple tomatoes every day to reach a similar potential benefit, yet Martin believes that's actually more feasible than eating the alternative of two handfuls of blueberries a day. That's because blueberries are expensive and highly seasonal, while her tomatoes could be cooked down into pasta or pizza sauce.  ( Yes, these tomatoes retain their captivating purplish hue when cooked ) .",

      "summary": "Trust is essential in any successful relationship whether family, friend, or coworker. In a professional setting, learning whom to trust can be particularly challenging given its potential economic and career impact. That's especially true today. As hierarchal organizations give way to more autonomous ways of working, trust is critical. Fewer in-person experiences also can make it harder to read between the lines. In his book The Speed of Trust, Stephen M.R. Covey describes it this way: \"Trust is a function of two things: character and competence. Character includes your integrity, your motive, your intent with people. Competence includes your capabilities, your skills, your results, your track record. And both are vital.\" I'd add a third component: consistency. Trust is reinforced or undermined based on past behavior. It's an important frame of reference. Together, character, competence, and consistency represent the essential elements of trust.",

While labor unions can be a powerful force, they are of little value to the people working today for food delivery and ride-sharing companies such as DoorDash, Grubhub, Lyft, and Uber. In 1954, 35% of all U.S. workers belonged to a labor union. Today, it's only 11%. The time has come for workers to find new and more innovative ways to secure livable wages and benefits. I've studied this issue extensively. I believe one option is for gig workers to band together, acquire stock in gig-economy companies, and sway management decisions as a powerful block of shareholders.",

      "summary": "One of the most successful of these projects centers on a community of disillusioned apes. The creative brainchild of four anonymous thirtysomethings, Bored Ape Yacht Club  ( BAYC )  is a collection of 10,000 unique ape avatars minted as NFTs that double as membership tokens to an exclusive online social club with real-world perks. The entire project sold out within 12 hours at an initial asking price of 0.08 ETH, about $190 USD at the time. But in the roughly nine months since the project's launch, it has become a cultural juggernaut, garnering interest from numerous celebrities, gracing magazine covers, and expanding beyond the Blockchain into the physical worlds of fashion, publishing, and music. As a result, the minimum price for a BAYC NFT has skyrocketed from a fancy dinner to a modest house. By the end of 2021, BAYC had already surpassed $1 billion USD in sales, achieving the milestone faster than many of the largest and most influential companies in the world.",
